# Advent of Code 2015

This repo contains my solutions and a diary for [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015/). I do these much later (it is 2021 as of this writing), just for fun and using GO a bit.

To run a single one:

```sh
$ go run main.go day01
```


To run them all:
 
```sh
$ go run main.go all
```

```
